# Benchmark results

Three test corpora: **v1** (53 samples: user recordings, EveryAyah reference, RetaSy crowdsourced), **v2** (43 samples: RetaSy expanded + EveryAyah multi-verse), and **v3** (256 samples: EveryAyah Alafasy+Husary singles/multis + TLOG-clean crowd-sourced filtered through shipped ONNX + user recordings). v3 exists to reduce the per-sample noise floor: on v1 a one-sample swing is ±1.9pp recall, whereas on v3 the same swing is ±0.4pp.

Metrics: **Recall** = fraction of expected verses found. **Precision** = fraction of emitted verses that were expected. **ExactSetAcc** = deduped emitted set exactly matches expected set, order ignored. **OrderedSeqAcc** = deduped emitted sequence exactly equals the expected ordered sequence. Older changelog entries and tables that say "SeqAcc" used the pre-rename set metric, so read them as ExactSetAcc unless a row explicitly says ordered.

Browser streaming reports now separate durable raw `verse_match` commits from silence-time `final_sequence`. Raw commit metrics remain the engineering guardrail for bad visible emissions. Final-sequence metrics measure the product contract after accumulated streaming evidence has had a chance to smooth or repair early hypotheses.

ONNX inference is non-deterministic at **±3–6 samples per run** on v1 — streaming numbers below are medians over 3 runs (except the deferred-emission changelog entry, which was measured at 5 runs).

## Shipped model

Current browser/runtime model: Zipformer2-CTC `interp-gentle-a0.5` int8 (`web/frontend/public/models/zipformer_interp_gentle_a05.int8.onnx`, 66 MB). Default engine in the Vite demo and in `@tilawa/core` (`createRecognitionSession()`); FastConformer stays behind `?engine=fastconformer`. The acoustic model is NPL-1.2; the word-level tracker is the native MIT recitation engine, now in the SDK at `packages/core/src/recitation/`. Batch champion is unchanged: Cyberistic's full-mixed text CTC FastConformer (`fastconformer_full_mixed.onnx`, 88 MB).

| Mode | Corpus | Recall | Precision | ExactSetAcc | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Zipformer browser streaming** (300ms chunks, native MIT engine) | v1 | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | 3-repeat median; OrderedSeqAcc also 100% (53/53 every run) |
| **Zipformer browser streaming** | v2 | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | blind check; 43/43 every run |
| **`c2c-direct-mixed-tta` full-file batch** | v1 | **100%** | **100%** | **100%** | Cyberistic champion, median across 3 reproduced runs |
| **`c2c-direct-mixed` full-file batch** | v1 | 98% | 98% | 98% | Same ONNX without 0.9x/1.1x TTA |

Historical pre-Zipformer browser/RN streaming baseline, using `fastconformer-phoneme v4-tlog` (131 MB quantized ONNX):

| Mode | Corpus | Recall | Precision | ExactSetAcc | Correct |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Browser/RN streaming** (300ms chunks, `RecitationTracker`) | v2 | **87.9%** | **68.9%** | **55.8%** | 37/43 |
| **Browser/RN streaming** | v3 | **89.3%** | **73.4%** | **58.2%** | 223–225/256 |
| Non-streaming (full-file, single `matchVerse()`) | v1 | 84.1% | 84.9% | 81.1% | 43/53 |
| Non-streaming (full-file, single `matchVerse()`) | v2 | 78.1% | 79.1% | 74.4% | 32/43 |

### Streaming changelog

**2026-09-17 — recitation engine moves into `@tilawa/core`, Zipformer becomes the SDK default** (commits `b51887b`, `cdfa864`)
The streaming phoneme engine was only reachable through the web demo; it now lives in the SDK at `packages/core/src/recitation/` (2,600 lines moved with `git mv`, no logic edits) behind a public `ZipformerSession` / `createZipformerSession()` API, and a top-level `createRecognitionSession({ engine })` selector defaults to `"zipformer"`. The browser worker, the Node stability report, and the Python harness (`lab/experiments/zipformer-ctc/harness.ts`) are now three thin consumers of one implementation instead of one implementation plus two copies of the host loop — the invariant this buys is that the demo's numbers and the lab's numbers can no longer drift apart silently. ONNX stays injected: `{ ort, model }` for web/node, `{ session, Tensor }` for React Native, so the package still imports no runtime. `bridgeGapAyahs` and the emission gate moved out of the harness into `emission.ts`, which is what made the harness a consumer rather than a fork.

Numbers: precision 100.0% → **100.0%** (0pp), SeqAcc 100.0% → **100.0%** (0pp), recall 100.0% → **100.0%** (0pp) on v1 (53/53). Same on v2 blind check (43/43). A pure refactor should move nothing, and nothing moved — the point of the measurement is that three repeats on each corpus were identical, as expected from this deterministic engine.

Raw JSON at `web/frontend/test/sdk-zipformer-v{1,2}-stability.json`; Python harness at `lab/benchmark/results/2026-09-17_103550.json` (100% / 100% / 100%, 0.84s/sample). 110 vitest cases pass — 60 in `packages/core`, 50 in `web/frontend` — of which 6 are new: the session API end-to-end against a scripted ORT stub that replays an Al-Fatiha phoneme timeline, plus the engine selector's default and its FastConformer branch. Note for future runs: `onnxruntime-node` aborts with exit 134 during process teardown *after* the stability report writes its JSON and prints its summary — a known ORT teardown crash, not a recognition failure.

**2026-09-16 — native MIT recitation engine replaces vendored tracker** (commit `9fd87fd`)
The Zipformer worker now runs `packages/core/src/recitation/`, a clean-room MIT TypeScript engine written from the behavioural spec (`docs/specs/recitation-engine-spec.md`) plus 23 dump-vector oracles. The vendored reference engine is gone from the frontend. Nothing was copied from that tree — vectors stayed exact, and ZipformerHost scores did not move.

Numbers: precision 100.0% → **100.0%** (0pp), SeqAcc 100.0% → **100.0%** (0pp), recall 100.0% → **100.0%** (0pp) on v1. Same pattern on v2 blind check. v3 248/256 unchanged (same 8 misses).

**2026-09-16 — Zipformer (interp-gentle-a0.5) is the default browser engine** (commit `9cfd295`)
The Vite demo now loads streaming Zipformer2-CTC (`interp-gentle-a0.5` int8, 66 MB) by default so the live UI matches the promoted acoustic model. FastConformer remains a complete fallback (`?engine=fastconformer` or `localStorage.tilawaEngine=fastconformer`); the status pill shows which engine is running. The ONNX and phoneme lexicon are NPL-1.2 Derivatives; the word-level tracker is the vendored reference engine pending a native port. Deploy pulls those two assets from GitHub release `yazinsai/tilawa` v0.3.0; `zipformer_interp_gentle_a05.io.json` is committed.

Numbers: precision 66.8% → **100.0%** (+33.2pp), SeqAcc 47.2% → **100.0%** (+52.8pp), recall 78.6% → **100.0%** (+21.4pp) on v1. Same pattern on v2 blind check: precision 68.9% → **100.0%** (+31.1pp), SeqAcc 55.8% → **100.0%** (+44.2pp), recall 87.9% → **100.0%** (+12.1pp). All three repeats were identical (v1 53/53, v2 43/43). v1 "before" is the last measured v1 streaming row (deferred-emission, 5-run); later tracker gates were scored on v2/v3 only. v2 "before" is the shipped phoneme FastConformer headline. `fastconformer_phoneme_q8.onnx` is not in this checkout, so the FastConformer path of `stability-report.ts` was not re-run.

npx tsx test/stability-report.ts --engine=zipformer --repeats=3 --corpus=test_corpus_v2 --json=test/zipformer-default-v2-stability.json
```
Raw JSON at `web/frontend/test/zipformer-default-stability.json` and `…-v2-stability.json`. 72 vitest cases pass (5 new: default engine is zipformer; `?engine=fastconformer` is honoured).

**2026-04-25 — decode-stability gate on single-cycle commits** (file: `web/frontend/src/lib/tracker.ts`)
A context-sweep diagnostic (`web/frontend/test/diagnose-context-sweep.ts`) measured how the model's CTC greedy decode of audio prefixes compares to its decode of the full audio. On v1 the result was striking: across prefix lengths from 1s to 5s, **~50% of every prefix-decode token gets revised** when full audio context arrives (median LCP / |prefix-decode| ≈ 0.50). Full-audio WER vs the expected phoneme reference is 14%, so the offline ceiling is fine — but every short-prefix decode sits in a regime where half its emissions are non-final because the FastConformer encoder uses bidirectional attention to refine early frames once more audio is in.

The browser's `RecitationTracker` was committing `verse_match` on single-cycle `clearMargin` paths — riding those unstable predictions. The fix gates that one path: track `lastRawPhonemes`, and require the current decode's Levenshtein ratio to the previous cycle's decode be ≥ 0.70 before allowing a single-cycle clearMargin commit. Repeated-leader and finalFlush commits are not gated (they have their own multi-cycle protection). Commit is denied with no diagnostic noise — the tracker either commits in this cycle, defers to the next, or eventually fires via the existing `repeatedLeader` path. Continuation jumps (the next ayah of the verse currently being tracked) are not gated either, since they're not the "early-frame instability" failure mode.

The gate is on by default; set `DECODE_STABILITY_GATE_OFF=1` in env to disable for benchmarking.

Numbers (3-repeat median):
- v3 (256 samples): recall 82.1% → **89.3%** (+7.2pp), precision 64.1% → **73.4%** (+9.3pp), SeqAcc 46.1% → **58.2%** (+12.1pp). Per-run correct [213, 204, 204] → [223, 225, 224]. **Stable-pass 186 → 216 (+30), stable-fail 30 → 25 (−5), flaky 40 → 15 (−25)** — the gate doesn't just lift the median, it makes the pipeline noticeably more deterministic.
- v2 blind check: recall 85.6% → **87.9%** (+2.3pp), precision 66.6% → **68.9%** (+2.3pp), SeqAcc 53.5% → **55.8%** (+2.3pp). Per-run correct [37, 36, 36] → [37, 37, 37]. Smaller gain than v3, consistent with v2 being mostly clean professional recitations where short-prefix decodes are less ambiguous to begin with — the bigger v3 win comes from the 80 noisier TLOG-clean samples where decode stability matters more.

The improvement is roughly an order of magnitude bigger than the prior streaming experiments because it targets a different failure class: not "score threshold tuning" (which the matcher/tracker attempts on 2026-04-21 exhausted) but "the upstream signal that scores are computed from is unreliable until enough context arrives." Three matcher tweaks moved nothing measurable on v1; this one moved v3 SeqAcc 12pp.

Targets specifically: long single-verse and multi-verse samples where an early streaming chunk happened to score well against a wrong verse and got committed before the correct verse's evidence accumulated. On v3 baseline-vs-gated diffs, samples like `tlog_m020_010_105` (got `[20:34]` baseline, suppressed and recovered with gate), `ea_alafasy_034005` (`[22:51, 22:52, 22:53]` → `[22:51]`), `multi_055_001_004` (`[20:5, 55:2, 55:3, 55:4]` → correct on gated runs in v1) flip from stable-fail to stable-pass.

The diagnostic that motivated this: `npx tsx test/diagnose-context-sweep.ts` — for each test sample, runs inference on prefixes [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]s of audio and reports phoneme WER vs the expected reference plus prefix-vs-full-decode stability. Reproduces the ~50% instability finding in ~2 min on a Mac.

```
Raw JSON at `web/frontend/test/stab-gate-{baseline,on}-{v2,v3}.json`. 38 vitest cases pass (no new cases — existing coverage exercises the unchanged commit paths; the gated path is exercised by `stability-report` on real audio because mocked tests run a single cycle and never hit the multi-cycle stability comparison).

**2026-04-22 — silence-flush pending emission on final flush** (commit `508844b`)
When the utterance ends and the tracker has auto-advanced to a pending next-verse emission that never got fresh-audio confirmation, emit the pending message instead of rolling it back — but only when the advance had strong acoustic evidence at the time. Specifically, capture `prefixScore - suffixScore` as `pendingEmissionMargin` at advance time (from the existing `ADVANCE_RELATIVE_MARGIN < 3.0` gate). On `finalFlush`, emit the pending message only when `pendingEmissionMargin < ADVANCE_FLUSH_STRICT_MARGIN` (0.5, much tighter than the normal advance gate). The tighter threshold prevents one-verse overshoot when the reciter actually stopped at the penultimate verse.

Numbers (3-repeat median):
- v3 (256 samples): recall 83.4% → 83.7% (+0.3pp), precision 63.5% → 64.4% (+0.9pp), SeqAcc 44.1% → **46.1%** (+2.0pp). Per-run correct [204, 207, 207] → [209, 212, 208]. **Stable-fail 34 → 28 (−6)** — the six samples gained are the structural win, not variance.
- v2 blind check: recall 82.7% → **85.6%** (+2.9pp), precision 63.7% → 68.1% (+4.4pp), SeqAcc 46.5% → 48.8% (+2.3pp). Same-direction movement on v2 confirms it's not an overfit to v3.

Targets specifically: `multi_114_001_006` (Al-Nas 1-6 dropping verse 6 on silence), `user_ikhlas_2_3` (Al-Ikhlas verses 2-3 dropping verse 3), and similar last-verse-of-span cases where utterance ends before the pending emission could be confirmed by fresh audio. SeqAcc gains more than recall because this fix specifically repairs the last component of ordered sequences, which is exactly what exact-match SeqAcc weighs.

**2026-04-22 — v3 benchmark corpus (256 samples)** (scripts: `benchmark/build_v3_corpus.py`, `benchmark/augment_v3_corpus.py`, `benchmark/tlog_filter_v3.py`)
After four consecutive falsified streaming experiments (three matcher/tracker + v7 streaming-aug training) all landing inside or just outside the ±3–6-sample v1 variance envelope, the bottleneck became measurement fidelity rather than idea generation. Rebuilt the corpus at ~5× the size.

Sources and composition:
- **EveryAyah singles (140)**: 80 short + 60 medium + 20 long, drawn by reciter-alternating across `Alafasy_128kbps` and `Husary_128kbps`, picked from shuffled Quran pools that don't overlap (surah, ayah) with v1/v2.
- **EveryAyah multi-ayah (20)**: 29 hand-picked 3–6-ayah sequences concatenated via ffmpeg pipe→f32le with 0.5s silence gaps and written at 16 kHz mono. 10 Shatri sequences 404'd (reciter dir not on everyayah.com); Alafasy + Husary sequences all succeeded. `Shatri_128kbps` does not exist on the CDN; six stale 404-HTML files landed on disk as `.mp3` and were removed during pruning, cutting 6 samples.
- **TLOG-clean 80**: replaces RetaSy entirely. TLOG's `clean` split is still noisy at the transcription level, so each candidate was streamed with `Audio(decode=False)`, ffmpeg-decoded to 16 kHz mono, greedy-CTC transcribed through the shipped FastConformer phoneme ONNX, and phoneme-compared against the canonical phoneme string for the filename-referenced (surah, ayah) in `quran_phonemes.json`. Only samples with Levenshtein ratio ≥ 0.75 pass; target 60 medium + 20 long. Hit the target in 12,180 scans (10 s median duration, median ratio 0.95, 2,129 rejected for ratio below threshold + 29 for decode failure).
- **User recordings (2)**: imran_23 + ikhlas_2_3 copied from v1.

Baseline at the time (3-repeat streaming, then-shipped v4-tlog phoneme ONNX):
- Per-run correct [204, 207, 207] / 256
- **Median recall 83.4%**, **precision 63.5%**, **SeqAcc 44.1%**
- Stable-pass 187, flaky 35, stable-fail 34

Compared to v1's 80.9% median recall, v3 shows the shipped pipeline at ~same headline recall but with **ten times the statistical power** per metric (σ of "correct" across the 3 runs is 1.7 samples on v3 vs 0.7 samples on v1, but in relative terms that's ±0.7pp vs ±1.3pp). This means a 3pp streaming improvement is now cleanly visible above noise, where on v1 it was indistinguishable from per-run jitter. Future attempts that were rejected as noise on v1 can be re-measured on v3; narrow tracker experiments (silence-flush final emission, late-verse stitching) now have a realistic path to acceptance.

Tracker raw results JSON: `web/frontend/test/v3-baseline-stability.json`. Both `stability-report.ts` and `benchmark/runner.py` already accept `--corpus=test_corpus_v3` without code changes.

**2026-04-22 — v7 streaming-aug training, falsified** (scaffold kept at `497fc91`, checkpoint discarded)
Curriculum-style fine-tune: start from v4-tlog weights, reuse v5-robust-u6 data (v4-tlog audio was not on the volume anymore), apply streaming-like augmentation (silence prob 0.2→0.6 + range 0.4s→1.5s, shift ±200→±400ms, white_noise prob 0.3→0.5, gain range widened). 3000 steps at LR 2e-5, best `val_loss=14.01` at step 3000 (still decreasing, but training completed as configured).

Ran 3-repeat v1 stability report against the shipped pipeline with the v7 ONNX swapped in. Per-run correct [35, 37, 35] vs v4 baseline [40, 39]; median **recall 71.7% (−9.2pp)**, **precision 60.6% (−6.2pp)**, **SeqAcc 43.4% (−3.8pp)**. Stable-pass 27 (−8), flaky samples 17 (+8). Outside ONNX variance — real regression.

Hypothesized cause: the expanded silence / shift windows shifted the model's output distribution such that in-distribution samples (v5-robust-u6 training data) got noisier CTC decodes at 300ms browser-streaming chunk sizes, not cleaner. The training signal optimizes full-utterance val_loss on full-audio inputs; streaming chunks see more of the augmentation than the full 10–30s training clip does (relative to its content). Put differently: the augmentor perturbs *seconds* of silence on a clip whose content is also seconds long, but at 300ms streaming that same perturbation is a qualitatively different signal.

Shipped ONNX restored to v4-tlog; v7 checkpoint discarded (stays on `fastconformer-phoneme-training` volume for possible revisit). Scaffold code (streaming-aug flag, init-from-checkpoint, manifest-reuse) kept in `scripts/train_fastconformer_phoneme_modal.py` for future training experiments. Raw stability JSON at `web/frontend/test/streaming-attempts-2026-04-21/v7-stream-aug-v1.json`.

**Takeaway:** data-augmentation matching the inference-time distribution is not obviously CTC-safe, even when the transcript is unchanged. A streaming-aware loss (e.g. compute CTC on random sub-windows of the clip) or direct streaming inference during training would be a more faithful approach.

**2026-04-21 — three matcher/tracker attempts, all falsified** (no commit — worktrees discarded)
Three narrow attempts to close the streaming-vs-batch gap. All landed **inside** the ±3–6 sample ONNX variance envelope on 2-run v1; none shipped. Baseline: 35 stable-pass / 9 stable-fail / 9 flaky, medianRecall 80.9%, medianSeqAcc 47.2%, per-run [40, 39] correct.

1. **Rare-phoneme n-gram surah expansion (always-on)** — ported the w2v-phonemes 5-gram rarity vote into `QuranDB.retrieveCandidates` to broaden the Pass 2 surah set when Levenshtein alone put the right surah outside the top-N. Result: seqAcc +0.9pp, **recall −2.2pp, precision −1.6pp**. The extra surah candidates surfaced spans whose coincidental ratio() beat the correct verse. `retasy_024` recovered but other samples regressed in compensation.
2. **Rare-phoneme n-gram, gated to low-text-confidence paths only** — same mechanism, activated only when the primary match is weak. Ship-blocking variance: per-run correct swung **[44, 34]**. One run at 44/53 was the best observed sample count across all attempts, but seqAcc dropped −5.7pp in the median.
3. **Short-text first-match gate** — raise `FIRST_MATCH_THRESHOLD` to 0.82/0.9 when decoded phoneme text is < 15/10 chars, to suppress the "short ambiguous chunk latches onto a distant verse" failure class (retasy_024/025: 1:7 → 82:11; multi_055: 55:1 → 20:5). Result: recall −1.7pp, seqAcc −1.0pp. Target failures still failed identically — the wrong verse wins at a cycle when text is already long enough to clear the gate.

Raw per-sample JSON lives in `web/frontend/test/streaming-attempts-2026-04-21/{baseline-main,ngram-always-on,ngram-gated,short-text-gate}-v1.json`. The working hypothesis is that these nine stable-fail samples are at the **ASR quality floor** (CTC decoded phonemes that genuinely look more like the wrong verse than the right one) and cannot be fixed by matcher/tracker tuning alone. The productive next lever is training-side (v7 streaming-aug fine-tune).

**2026-04-11 — deferred emission** (commit `63774dc`)  
Auto-advanced `verse_match` messages are now held as *pending* until fresh audio produces primary word alignment on the next verse; if tracking stales, the pending emission is silently dropped with full state rollback. This prevents cascades where verse N completing triggers emission of N+1, N+2, … without audio evidence.

v1: precision **53.8% → 66.8%** (+13.0pp), SeqAcc **26.4% → 47.2%** (+20.8pp), recall **78.9% → 78.6%** (−0.3pp). Same pattern on v2 blind check. 0 stable-pass → stable-fail regressions across 5 runs.

Measurement tool: `npx tsx web/frontend/test/stability-report.ts --repeats=5 [--corpus=test_corpus_v2]` produces per-sample stability classification + JSON.

**2026-04-03 — Phase A fixes**  
Short-utterance CTC rescue, span-aware commit, acoustic-dominant override. Also widened our understanding of variance: ONNX is ±3–6 samples/run on v1 (not ±2–3 as previously assumed). Earlier one-shot 45/53 and 50/53 figures sat at the high end of that distribution; the realistic pre-deferred-emission streaming baseline was 40–44/53.

## All experiments — streaming (Python, 3s chunks)

`StreamingPipeline` feeds 3s audio segments to each model, accumulates text into `VerseTracker` for progressive matching. Mirrors the browser pattern but with larger chunks.

### Phoneme matcher: strategy comparison

Historical ONNX phoneme model via Python `predict()`, swapping out the matching strategy:

| Matching strategy | v1 Recall | v1 SeqAcc | v2 Recall | v2 SeqAcc |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Simple `ratio()` | 79% | 75% | 87% | 86% |
| **Multi-pass (fragment + span)** | **90%** | **87%** | **87%** | **84%** |

The multi-pass matcher (ported from the browser's `quran-db.ts` — fragment scoring, short-query boost, bismillah stripping, multi-verse spans) adds +11pp v1 recall at zero decode cost. Matching quality was the bottleneck, not decoding.

### 0% recall — broken or inapplicable

| Experiment | Base model | Type | Size | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| contrastive | HuBERT + AraBERT | embedding | 900 MB | English encoder → useless Arabic features |
| contrastive-v2 | HuBERT + AraBERT | embedding | 367 MB | Same fundamental issue as v1 |
| embedding-search | HuBERT + FAISS | embedding | 397 MB | HuBERT encodes speaker identity, not content |

## Deep dive: Rabah pruned CTC variants

Layer pruning + optional fine-tuning applied to `rabah2026/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-arabic-quran-v_final`.

| Variant | Layers | Pruning | FT | v1 Rec | v1 Seq | v2 Rec | v2 Seq | Lat | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8L-ft-fn-int8 | 8 | first_n | ✓ | **75%** | **74%** | **77%** | **77%** | 3.7s | 145 MB |
| 12L-ft-es-int8 | 12 | evenly_spaced | ✓ | 63% | 60% | 67% | 67% | 5.3s | 193 MB |
| 12L-int8 | 12 | evenly_spaced | — | 62% | 62% | 51% | 51% | 5.5s | 193 MB |
| 8L-ft-es-int8 | 8 | evenly_spaced | ✓ | 55% | 55% | 47% | 47% | 4.0s | 145 MB |
| 6L-ft-es-int8 | 6 | evenly_spaced | ✓ | 54% | 51% | 56% | 56% | 3.3s | 121 MB |
| 8L-int8 | 8 | evenly_spaced | — | 2% | 2% | 0% | 0% | 4.0s | 145 MB |
| 6L-int8 | 6 | evenly_spaced | — | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 3.2s | 121 MB |

`first_n` pruning (keep layers 0–7) beats `evenly_spaced` by ~20pp at the same layer count. Fine-tuning the CTC head is non-optional — unfinetuned pruned models score near 0%.

## Deep dive: TLOG data-mix fine-tunes

Fine-tuning the phoneme CTC head with varying amounts of TLOG (phone-recorded recitation).

| Model | TLOG | Filter | Streaming v1 | Streaming v2 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **v4-tlog** (shipped) | ~18K (5/verse) | 0.3 | **45/53 (85%)** † | **32/43 (74%)** † | best checkpoint |
| v5-robust-u6 | 0 (no TLOG) | — | 43/53 (81%) | 33/43 (77%) | removing TLOG also hurts |
| v4-tlog-heavy | ~53K (15/verse) | 0.3 | 36–38/53 (70%) | 25/43 (58%) | regression |
| v4-tlog-hq | ~74K (30/verse) | 0.5 | 29–31/53 (56%) | 23–24/43 (54%) | bigger regression |
| v6-augmented | ~29K (5/verse) | none | 26/53 (49%) NS | — | +MUSAN +teacher relabel, worst |

† v4-tlog figures are single-run; the post-Phase-A median was 40–44/53 v1.

**Takeaways:** ~18K TLOG at filter=0.3 is a genuine sweet spot. Scaling up volume regresses; removing TLOG also regresses; combining multiple data-side changes (v6) makes attribution impossible. **Rule: one data change per training run.**

**v6-augmented failure detail:** unfiltered TLOG (29K) + teacher pseudo-labels on 75% of samples + MUSAN noise aug, all together. Training metrics looked healthy (val_loss=58.39 at step 6500) but downstream accuracy collapsed. Unfiltered TLOG alone contains ~38% bad samples per the quality filter; the teacher relabeler added an unknown additional error rate on the rest. Streaming export also crashed with an ONNX mutex error (NeMo <2.7 compat).

## Zipformer2-CTC (streaming phoneme model + fine-tunes)

Base weights are `Quran-Lab/zipformer_p-arabic-v3` v3.1 (HF; NPL-1.2 — share-alike, non-commercial; see [NOTICE.md](../NOTICE.md)), int8 via `quantize_dynamic(MatMul QInt8)`, streaming contract T=61/hop=48/left 256, trained by the authors with chunk mix 8/16/24 frames (which is why we fine-tune at `--chunk-size 8,16,24`). Our tracker/harness and all fine-tunes are ours. Checkpoints live at volume path `/vol/reference/`; local copy `data/zipformer/reference/`.

CTC first-batch 0.6411 (pretrained, <1.0). `metrics.jsonl`: ep1 train 0.1066 / valid 0.0884; ep5 train 0.0796 / valid 0.0324. Wall 9536 s (~2.65 h). Max GPU mem ~18 GB / 80 GB. Epoch-3 valid 0.0342 is worse than ep4/5 — no extra `--epoch 3 --avg 1` export.

Promotion bar (strict): qlab ≥ 572 AND v1 = 53 AND v3 ≥ 247 vs v3.1 baseline 571 / 53 / 247. **NOT PROMOTED** — qlab 566/583, v1 45/53, v3 231/256. tlog_holdout 188/199 vs 194; nufais 194/200 vs 193 (the only slice that improved). int8 matches fp32 scores, ~20% faster.

v1/v3 regressions are mostly multi-ayah truncation (first 1–2 ayahs only). qlab: −6 tlog_holdout, +1 nufais (`qul_alnufais__37_43`). ONNX PER **4.37%** (EA 1.69 / nufais 4.59 / tlog 8.18; exact 61.6%) vs v3.1 **5.56%** — acoustics improved, tracker SeqAcc did not.

Epoch sweep (fp32 `--avg 1` except ep5 avg 3; one deterministic harness run):

| ckpt | v1 | v3 |
|---|---|---|
| v3.1 init | **53/53** | **247/256** |
| ep1 avg1 | 46/53 | 225/256 |
| ep2 avg1 | 44/53 | 214/256 |
| ep5 avg3 | 45/53 | 231/256 |

Most of the damage is epoch 1; epoch 2 is the trough; epoch 5 recovers some v3 but not v1. Not a clean “more FT → worse” slope.

**Failure mode (ep5, 5 v3 multi clips):** mixed acoustic + matcher, acoustic first. CTC transcript **drops short connecting ayahs** (Fatiha 1:3/1:4/1:6 absent; Fil 105:2/105:4 absent; 25:66 head absent). Later ayahs that *are* in the transcript often still get tracker tallies (`ok` full), but (1) `MIN_WORD_FRACTION=0.5` rejects partials (109:4 ok+unsure=2/5 words; 25:66 unsure=1/4) and (2) `predict()` `_contiguous_head` stops at the first gap so SeqAcc looks like prefix truncation (1:1–7→1:1–2 even though 1:5 and 1:7 were emitted). Needs B1 multi-ayah windows and/or tracker re-tune (`okDistance`/`unsureDistance`/word-fraction + don't truncate at holes).

### E2 gentle fine-tune + interpolation (PROMOTED: interp-gentle-a0.5)

Hypothesis: lr 0.005 over-fit in epoch 1; a 1-ep lr 0.001 FT, or a WiSE-FT blend with the v3.1 init, keeps PER gain without dropping multi-ayah. `--export-interp INIT_PT:FT_PT:ALPHA` inverse-permutes the reference CTC head to icefall blank=0 *before* `alpha*ft+(1-alpha)*init` (`998f34c`). ft-v31 blends used **epoch-5.pt** (not avg-3).

`ft-gentle` (`ap-1tiu0kP4AiIsn2sxQzLooc`, H100:4, 1 ep, lr 0.001, warmup 1000, avg 1): train 0.1108 / valid 0.0832 / 1662 s — **not** gentler on the tracker (v1 44/53, v3 225/256, same prefix-truncation as ft-v31 ep1). **interp-gentle-a0.5** (init ⊕ ft-gentle ep1, `ap-qj8yZzLGTgg9CZnexqPIka`) is **53 / 248 / 572** (EA 184, nufais 194, tlog 194): v3 gained `tlog_m000_100_001`, qlab gained `qul_alnufais__37_43`. interp-ftv31-a0.5 hits 572/248 but v1 52 (`multi_036_001_005` 36:1–5→36:2–5); a0.25 keeps v1 53 but v3 246 (`ea_alafasy_multi_044_001_005`). **PROMOTED** vs bar qlab≥572 AND v1=53 AND v3≥247. Shipping artefact is dynamic-int8 MatMul QInt8: **259,593,848 B fp32 / 69,245,985 B int8**; int8 matches fp32 on v1/v3/qlab and is **43/43** on v2 (recovers `retasy_v2_012`). Raw: `2026-09-15_210522.json`–`_220939.json`; int8 `_224627` (v1) `_224703` (v2) `_225000` (v3) `_225419` (qlab); PER `interp_gentle_a0.5_qlab_per.json`, `ft_gentle_qlab_per.json`.

### E1 multi-ayah windows (NOT PROMOTED; interp-gentle-a0.5 stays)

Hypothesis: isolated-ayah FT forgot short connector ayahs; synthetic 2–4 ayah windows (`everyayah_multi`) recover multi-verse SeqAcc. Built 40,000 windows (179.4 h raw, 0 OOV, n_ayahs 2/3/4 = 22198/11903/5899, mean 7.02 phonemes/s) from EveryAyah via lhotse `append` + 0–800 ms silence (noise mix skipped — inode cap). MixedCut left window text on ayah-1 (`f9070dc` put it on the first non-padding track; `888f31a` flattened fbank to MonoCut so icefall collates whole-cut text against `cut.num_frames` instead of the first-ayah interval). Mix `everyayah,everyayah_multi,tlog,iqra` (no qua), lr 0.002, 2 ep, H100:4. Loss: ep1 train 0.160 / valid 0.153 (986 s); ep2 0.134 / 0.073 (898 s).

Multi windows **do** repair raw FT multi-ayah (ft-v31 9/21 → ft-multi ep2 **19/21**) but the studio-heavy reduced mix wrecks the phone slice (tlog 194 → 174; qlab 551). ep1 is milder on tlog (180) and v1 (46) but weaker on v3 (223, multi 17/21). **interp-multi-a0.5** (0.5·v3.1 ⊕ 0.5·ft-multi ep1, sha `0cf247b3`) is 53/42/248/572 (multi 21/21, single 227/235, qlab 184/194/194) — ties interp-gentle-a0.5 on v1/v3/qlab, loses v2 42 vs 43. **interp-gentle-a0.5 remains the promoted candidate.** Next: multi windows + full mix + gentle LR, then blend. Raw: `2026-09-16_064849.json` (ep2 v1, `29644ea2`), `_065228` (v3), `_065748` (qlab); `_071046` (ep1 v1, `c8d7cd51`), `_071131` (v2), `_071510` (v3), `_072026` (qlab); interp `_070025` (v1), `_070110` (v2), `_070447` (v3), `_071003` (qlab). Report `.superpowers/sdd/plan-sota-tilawa/exp-E1-report.md`.

### E4 multi windows + full mix + gentle FT (NOT PROMOTED; interp-gentle-a0.5 stays)

Hypothesis: E1's tlog collapse was the missing qua/full mix, not the windows; combine windows (mux weight 2.5 → ~27% of 5,061 perturbed hours) with E2's gentle schedule, then blend. `ft-multi-full` (`ap-ZRkTcdmpX5RdZOtW92dA9N`, H100:4, 2 ep, lr 0.001, warmup 1000, `--source-weights everyayah_multi=2.5`): ep1 train 0.120 / valid 0.081 (1896 s), ep2 0.109 / 0.039 (1777 s). Raw FT still dies — ep1 45/39/228(multi **11/21**)/563(tlog 185); ep2 47/41/225(10/21)/551(tlog 173). Windows only repaired multi when they dominated a *small* mix (E1, no qua); diluted by qua they do not. **interp-mf1-a0.5** and **interp-mf2-a0.5** (sha `7bfc65f0` / `fdee4541`) are 53/43/248/572 with the **same miss set** as interp-gentle-a0.5; PER 4.27% vs 4.09%. a0.25 drops the two E2-gain clips (`tlog_m000_100_001`, `qul_alnufais__37_43`); a0.75 drops `retasy_016` on v1. **NOT PROMOTED** (qlab tie, not strictly greater). Raw: `2026-09-16_090027.json`–`_100159.json`; PER `interp_mf1_a0.5_qlab_per.json`. Report `.superpowers/sdd/plan-sota-tilawa/exp-E4-report.md`.

### E3 tracker re-tune (diagnostic, NOT PROMOTED)

Matcher-only probe on ft-v31 ep5 avg-3 (`sha256` `7c7f0f4d…`). v2 grid of 12 configs: only `ZIPFORMER_ALLOW_GAPS=1` appeared to move v2 (40/43), via `_contiguous_head` inventing a corpus-short hole. Fix round 1 requires both neighbours already emitted and `ok+unsure≥1`, and Python skips a hole only if that ayah is already in `verses`. After that, ft-v31+gaps = default: **45/53, 39/43, 231/256, 566/583**. The three “recovered” clips (`multi_036_001_005`, `ea_multi_056_001_004`, `ea_alafasy_multi_095_001_005`) revert. Reference + gaps stays **53/247/571**. Not a promotion candidate — the loss is acoustic, not a prefix-fill matcher bug. Raw: grid `2026-09-15_205959.json`–`_211248.json`; honest re-verify `_220245` (v1), `_222224` (v2), `_220911` (v3), ref `_221000`/`_221313`/`_222037`.

### Miss adjudication with Gemini 3.1 Pro

Blind + A/B informed listen of the 22 v3.1/interp-gentle misses (21 v3+qlab + `retasy_v2_012`). `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` / `gemini-pro-latest` return free-tier limit 0 on the AI Studio key; ran `generateContent` on Flash (`gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`), temperature 0, JSON schema. Control: 3/3 unique v3 shorts (`ea_alafasy_056058` 56:58, `ea_husary_081008` 81:8, `ea_husary_106003` 106:3) identified blindly.

**16 IDENTICAL_TEXT / 4 LABEL_WRONG / 2 LABEL_OK_MODEL_WRONG / 0 BAD_CLIP / 0 UNCLEAR.** Duplicate-ayah collisions are the bulk (qlab 11/12, v3 5/9): ASR cannot pick among textually identical copies, and Gemini's own blind ID hops between those copies too. The four LABEL_WRONG are all v3 tlog gold errors (100:1 missing 100:2; 107:1 is 106:4; two clips labelled 10:43 are 10:42). The only genuine v3.1 errors are `qul_alnufais__37_43` (37:43 → 52:17) and `retasy_v2_012` (1:3 → 55:1); interp-gentle-a0.5 already recovers both. **Ceiling on current labels:** v3.1 is one qlab + one v2 miss behind the unsolvable-duplicate floor; interp-gentle-a0.5 is **at** that floor (**248/256**, **572/583**). Further SeqAcc requires a duplicate-ayah tie-break and/or relabeling those four tlog clips — not more fine-tuning.

### Oracle check of the remaining misses (Gemini 3.1 Pro, 2026-09-16)

The 21 clips still missed by the v3.1 base and/or interp-gentle-a0.5 were independently transcribed with `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (raw transcripts scored against `quran.json`; see `artifacts/gemini_oracle/`). 14 of 16 confusable pairs are verbatim-identical text — 55:53/55:30/55:40↔55:13, 81:19↔69:40, 37:82↔26:66, 26:122↔26:9, 37:43↔56:12, 21:38↔10:48, 83:13↔68:15, 37:176↔26:204, 70:29↔23:5, 77:45↔77:15, 38:73↔15:30, 38:79↔15:36 — so the ID is undecidable from audio alone. Two `test_corpus_v3` labels are wrong: `tlog_m043_010_043` and `tlog_m044_010_043` are 10:42 (the model's prediction); `tlog_m008_107_001` is 106:4 followed by 107:1 (label incomplete); `qul_alnufais__8_51` uses بظلام (3:182 wording) — a probable label/recitation variant. Zero genuine model errors remain on distinguishable unique text, so the effective ceiling is **251/256** on v3 (not 249) and **≈573–574/583** on q-lab without context priors. Remaining SeqAcc has to come from previous-ayah / surah continuity, which the tracker's `hint` mechanism already supports. Manifests are unchanged; gold issues are in `benchmark/test_corpus_v3/KNOWN_LABEL_ISSUES.md`.

## Per-experiment notes

**c2c-direct-mixed-tta** — Cyberistic's winning entry and current champion. It runs the mixed int4+int8 FastConformer ONNX once at 1.0x speed, skips augmentation for confident predictions, and only runs 0.9x/1.1x speed-perturbed passes on low-confidence samples. Reproduced locally over 3 runs at 100% recall, 100% precision, and 100% sequence accuracy on v1 (53 samples), with 0.84s average latency.

**c2c-direct-mixed** — Same CTC re-rank algorithm without TTA, using `web/frontend/public/fastconformer_full_mixed.onnx` (88 MB). This is the model now loaded by the browser worker. Reproduced at 98% recall / 98% precision / 98% sequence accuracy on v1 at 0.72s average latency; TTA recovers the remaining miss.

**zipformer-ctc** — Streaming Zipformer2-CTC phoneme model (v3.1 base weights, NPL-1.2) run through our own recitation engine (`packages/core/src/recitation/`); benchmark wrapper in `experiments/zipformer-ctc/`; runner alias `prompter-zipformer` keeps historical result JSON names. Key finding: Streaming Zipformer2-CTC over a 251-token tajweed-phoneme vocab (letters+harakat, madd length as repetition), greedy CTC, then a whole-Quran 5-gram phoneme index + graded-cost semi-global alignment to locate, and a per-surah online DP tracker with per-word verdicts. The harness runs a recognize-mode host loop (search → track → verdicts, re-search after silence) and emits ayahs with ≥50% ok/unsure words; because the live engine refuses to lock on short clips, a whole-ayah nearest-match fallback over the same phoneme distance handles clips where no lock happened (pure engine: 74% v1; with fallback: 100%). Deterministic across runs (no ±3–6 sample jitter). **v1 53/53, v2 42/43, v3 247/256 (96.9% / 96.7% / 96.5%), qlab 571/583 (97.9%)** on the v3.1 base. Native MIT harness + interp-gentle-a0.5 (2026-09-17): **v1 53/53, v2 43/43** (`benchmark/results/2026-09-17_065319.json`, `2026-09-17_065532.json`). vs champion `c2c-direct-mixed-tta` at 241/256 (94.8% / 94.9% / 94.1%) on the same v3 run — it takes all 8 Husary multi-verse samples the champion loses. Remaining v3 misses are textually identical/near-identical ayahs (`55:53→55:13`, `81:19→69:40`, `37:82→26:66`, `30:1→2:1`, `26:122→26:9`, `10:43→10:42`), plus one short crowd clip (`107:1→106:4`) and one over-run (`100:1` → `100:1,100:2`). Takeaways for our stack: (1) a phoneme alphabet that encodes harakat + madd length gives the matcher far more discriminative chars per second than BPE text; (2) locate-then-track with graded substitution costs beats per-chunk `matchVerse()` on multi-verse; (3) the shipped 69 MB int8 is already the v3.1 base checkpoint — fine-tune that, don't train from scratch. Runs at ~5% RTF single-threaded CPU.

**ctc-alignment** — CTC forced alignment with `jonatasgrosman/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-arabic` (1.2 GB). Scores verses directly against frame-level logits via the CTC forward algorithm, skipping greedy-decode information loss. Too large (6×) and too slow (5×) for on-device.

**nvidia-fastconformer** — `nvidia/stt_ar_fastconformer_hybrid_large_pcd_v1.0`. Best speed/accuracy/size balance for streaming. A fine-tune sweep (v1, v2a, v2b, v3c) failed to beat the zero-shot baseline.

**fastconformer-ctc-rescore** — Two-stage: FastConformer ASR + CTC re-score top-50 candidates with the fine-tuned 8L Rabah head. Re-scoring doesn't recover failures — both models miss the same hard cases (short isolated letters, multi-verse).

**fastconformer-nbest-bruteforce** — N-best beam search + CTC brute-force. Regressed vs baseline: beam candidates without an LM are near-identical. A Quran-specific LM or constrained decode would be needed.

**fastconformer-lm-fusion** — FastConformer + pyctcdecode Quran LM. Best batch SeqAcc (94% v1, 95% v2) but too much added latency for streaming and awkward in-browser.

**fastconformer-phoneme** — Fine-tuned FastConformer CTC head on a 69-phoneme Buckwalter vocab. Former shipped ONNX model (`fastconformer_phoneme_q8.onnx`, 131 MB), now kept for historical experiments and streaming-regression comparisons. Trained on 71K Iqra + 55K TTS + 1.8K RetaSy + ~18K filtered TLOG.

**w2v-phonemes** — Phoneme CTC + Levenshtein matching. `large-int8` (r7, 970 MB INT8 ONNX) hits **100% batch on v1 and 96.1% / 96.1% / 96.1% (recall/precision/SeqAcc) on v3** — the strongest batch oracle we have, but 1 GB is too large to ship to browser. `base` (r15_95m, 388 MB fp32) is now accessible with Ahmed's read token and hit **97.1% / 97.1% / 97.1%** on the downloadable EveryAyah slice of v3 (174 samples, avg 0.90s CPU, result `benchmark/results/2026-04-29_091708.json`). A Modal-exported local dynamic-int8 ONNX (`base-local-int8`, 118 MB, artifacts in `data/r15-onnx/` or Modal volume `w2v-phonemes-r15`) preserved the same **97.1% / 97.1% / 97.1%** on that slice, with avg CPU latency 1.11s (result `benchmark/results/2026-04-29_100633.json`), and scored **96.0% / 96.1% / 95.7%** on full v3 (256 samples, avg 0.89s CPU, result `benchmark/results/2026-04-29_103225.json`). Both fp32 and int8 fail the same five EveryAyah short/repeated-phrase collisions (`55:53→55:13`, `81:19→69:40`, `37:82→26:66`, `30:1→2:1`, `26:122→26:9`), so the remaining batch error is mostly context/ambiguity rather than acoustic quality. A phoneme-aware naive chunked baseline (`predict_streaming`, 3s independent chunks) scored only **20.6% / 12.2% / 3.9%** on full v3 (result `benchmark/results/2026-04-29_103627.json`), confirming r15 is a batch/verifier model, not a true streaming model. O(T²) wav2vec2 attention and independent chunk CTC collapse are the blockers; use r15/r7 as verifier/teacher while true streaming should be cache-aware FastConformer RNNT/CTC. As of 2026-04-22 `_decode_phonemes` chunks audio >25s into 25s windows with 1s overlap, each independently CTC-collapsed then concatenated — without chunking, a single 200s sample bloats memory to 22 GB and effectively hangs on Apple Silicon's ArmKleidiAI MatMul path. Upstream `base-int8` (`hetchyy/r15_95m_onnx_int8`) still returns 404 on HF; our local `base-local-int8` entry is shown only when `data/r15-onnx/model_int8.onnx` or `R15_ONNX_DIR/model_int8.onnx` exists. HF token required for fp32.

Use case: r7 remains the highest-accuracy distillation teacher; r15 is now a plausible server-side/batch verifier and quantization candidate if a real int8 export can be produced.

**tadabur-whisper-small** — Best Whisper fine-tune we tested. Highest streaming recall (87% v1) at 3× FastConformer latency.

**rabah-pruned-ctc** — Layer-pruned Rabah CTC; see deep-dive above.

**two-stage** — Moonshine Tiny Arabic (103 MB) for fast ASR + CTC re-score on top 50 candidates, falling back to a large CTC. Blocked on the small CTC model.

**whisper-lora / whisper-small** — Whisper-small base + optional LoRA. LoRA helps vs base; both trail FastConformer, especially streaming.

**distilled-ctc (failed)** — wav2vec2-base knowledge-distilled from a large CTC teacher. English-only pretraining means no usable Arabic speech features.

**contrastive / contrastive-v2 / embedding-search (failed)** — All three failed for the same reason: English-pretrained audio encoders (HuBERT, wav2vec2-base) don't produce useful features for Arabic.

## Key findings

1. **FastConformer dominates for streaming.** Best speed/accuracy/size tradeoff across every viable experiment.
2. **CTC forced alignment is the most accurate batch approach**, but too large (1.2 GB) for on-device.
3. **ASR quality is the bottleneck.** All ASR-based approaches fail on the same samples.
4. **English-pretrained audio encoders fail on Arabic.** wav2vec2-base, HuBERT, Moonshine can't produce useful features.
5. **Pruning + fine-tuning works.** 24→8 layers with `first_n` pruning + CTC fine-tuning recovers most accuracy (75% at 145 MB).
6. **Short verses are hard across all approaches** — under 3–4 words doesn't give enough signal.
7. **Matching quality matters more than decode strategy.** Multi-pass phoneme matching takes Python batch from 79%→90% v1. pyctcdecode beam is worse than greedy for this model.
8. **Beam-candidate injection into the tracker regressed.** The verse/span trie (1.7M nodes, 2.2ms decode) works correctly, but beam-matched verses override correct greedy results. Surah-level expansion is the safer next step.
9. **TLOG: one quality-filtered bucket wins.** ~18K filtered at 0.3 is the sweet spot; more volume, lower filter, no TLOG, or combined data changes all regress.
10. **Streaming precision had a cascade bug.** Auto-advanced `verse_match` messages emitted without audio evidence. Deferred emission (2026-04-11) fixes it: +13pp precision, +20.8pp SeqAcc on v1.
11. **Cyberistic's text CTC rerank moved the batch ceiling.** `c2c-direct-mixed-tta` is now the v1 champion at 100% / 100% / 100% with an 88 MB ONNX. The previous v4-tlog phoneme model remains useful as a historical streaming baseline, but new shipped runtime work should start from `fastconformer_full_mixed.onnx`, `vocab.json`, and `quran_ctc_tokens.json`.
12. **r7 (Ahmed's 1B wav2vec2 phoneme CTC) is still a strong v3 batch oracle.** 96.1% / 96.1% / 96.1% on v3 (256 samples, full-file batch), but 1 GB is too large to ship and wav2vec2 attention is not streaming-friendly. Use r7/r15 as teacher/verifier candidates, not the browser runtime.
13. **v3 SeqAcc is mostly a tracker state problem, not a recognizability problem.** Exact-match diagnostics (`web/frontend/test/analyze-v3-stability.ts`) show the v3 gap is dominated by extra emissions: cached streaming exact-fail runs include 124 `extra_after_expected` and 29 `wrong_surah_jump` cases across 768 runs. Comparing those cached streaming outputs against the r7 batch oracle (`web/frontend/test/compare-streaming-oracle.ts --stability-json=... --oracle-results=benchmark/results/r7-v3-batch.json`) shows the first long/medium exact-fail samples are `streaming_tracker_loss`: r7 predicts the exact expected verse while streaming emits expected+extras. The old phoneme ONNX full-file path was too weak to serve as this oracle; it often missed the expected verse on those same long clips. Two tempting runtime invariants were falsified and reverted: consuming the buffer after evidence-backed stale exits, and blocking selected candidates dominated by the current fusion leader. The next tracker attempt needs explicit segment ownership / active-hypothesis comparison, not score-threshold or rank gates.
14. **The v3.1 base model ships as onnxruntime dynamic-int8; int8 and fp32 score identically through our tracker, so int8 (66 MB) is the shipping artefact.** Tracker scores are deterministic; v3.1 vs v3 only swap one v1/v2 crowd clip. Fine-tune v3.1 rather than training Zipformer CTC from scratch.
15. **A 5-epoch full-mix fine-tune of v3.1 at lr 0.005 dropped tracker SeqAcc even as CTC valid loss fell 0.088→0.032 and ONNX PER 5.56%→4.37%.** ft-v31: v1 53→45, v3 247→231, qlab 571→566 (tlog −6, nufais +1). Failures are mostly multi-ayah truncations, not wrong-surah. Lower LR / fewer epochs / freeze encoder next — do not ship this checkpoint.
16. **Fine-tuning v3.1 on isolated-ayah data lowers PER but breaks multi-ayah tracking.** Epoch sweep (fp32): v1 53→46→44→45 and v3 247→225→214→231 at init/ep1/ep2/ep5. CTC skips short connecting ayahs (acoustic); `MIN_WORD_FRACTION=0.5` plus `_contiguous_head` then report only the prefix (matcher). **E1 B1 windows repair that failure** (ft-v31 9/21 multi → ft-multi ep2 19/21) but a reduced studio-heavy mix wrecks tlog (194→174). **E4** put the same windows in the full mix at mux ×2.5 (~27% of hours) + E2's gentle LR: raw multi stays broken (11/21) because qua still dominates; α=0.5 blends (interp-mf1-a0.5 / interp-mf2-a0.5) **tie** interp-gentle-a0.5 on 53/43/248/572 with an identical miss set and worse PER (4.27% vs 4.09%). α=0.5 of a mild FT is an attractor, not a knob that stacks data recipes. interp-gentle-a0.5 stays the promoted candidate. Matcher-only (E3) recovered 0 misses.
17. **Gemini 3.1 Pro oracle on remaining Zipformer misses: 0 genuine model errors.** Independent `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` transcripts of the 21 reference/interp-gentle misses (2026-09-16): 14/16 confusable pairs are verbatim-identical in `quran.json` and undecidable from audio. v3 gold has two confirmed mislabels (`tlog_m043_010_043`, `tlog_m044_010_043` are 10:42) plus an incomplete span (`tlog_m008_107_001` is 106:4 then 107:1); qlab `qul_alnufais__8_51` uses بظلام (3:182 wording). Effective ceiling is **251/256** v3 (not 249) and **≈573–574/583** q-lab without context priors — further gains need the tracker's `hint` (previous ayah / surah continuity), not more isolated-ayah FT. Manifests unchanged; see `artifacts/gemini_oracle/misses_oracle.json` and `benchmark/test_corpus_v3/KNOWN_LABEL_ISSUES.md`.

## Methodology

- **Batch:** experiment's `transcribe()` processes the full audio file. `StreamingPipeline` matches transcript against all 6,236 verses via Levenshtein. Per-sample R/P/SeqAcc, averaged.
- **Python streaming:** 3s chunks, independent transcription per chunk, accumulated text fed to `VerseTracker` for progressive matching.
- **Browser/RN streaming:** `RecitationTracker` feeds 300ms chunks through ONNX with a 4s silence tail to flush discovery. Current runtime uses Cyberistic's raw-audio `fastconformer_full_mixed.onnx`; older stability artifacts before the swap used `fastconformer_phoneme_q8.onnx`.
- **Latency:** wall-clock per sample, excluding first-sample warmup. Apple Silicon (CPU).
- **Variance:** ONNX inference is non-deterministic at ±3–6 samples/run on v1. Always report medians over 3 runs (max).

Raw JSON results live in `benchmark/results/`. Stability JSON from streaming runs lives in `web/frontend/test/*-stability.json`.

## Roadmap

Designs in `docs/plans/` for the work remaining between 78.6% streaming recall and the 95% target:

- **Curriculum / hard-example fine-tune (v7)** — start from v4-tlog, short low-LR second stage weighted by current failure buckets: short/noisy RetaSy, huruf-muqatta'at openers, clipped-start TLOG.
- **Streaming-like augmentation** — explicit start/end truncation, mild reverb, random short-window crops, adjacent-ayah concatenation. Current augmentor only has speed/gain/noise/shift/silence; the model never sees what streaming actually produces.
- **Phoneme n-gram anchoring in the browser matcher** — port rare-phoneme voting from `experiments/w2v-phonemes/` into `quran-db.ts` for surah-level expansion when `ratio()` is weak.
- **Teacher distillation (w2v-phonemes/large → FastConformer)** — use the 100%-batch teacher to generate soft labels. The earlier failed distillation used English wav2vec2-base as the student; that's what falsified, not the distillation idea.
- **Segment-aware tracker state** — replace implicit "current rolling buffer" ownership with explicit audio segments / active verse hypotheses. Diagnostics show stale exits after real word/acoustic progress can replay already-assigned audio through open discovery, causing expected+extra cascades. A safe fix should compare rediscovery candidates against the active verse/segment hypothesis before emitting, rather than relying on elapsed-time lockouts, rank gates, or buffer clearing.
- **Deferred A4 — gated trie beam candidate expansion** — expand the candidate surah set (don't inject direct candidates). Beam infrastructure already wired in `inference.ts`. A partial beam-derived surah-expansion probe was reverted because uncalibrated beam hints still pushed wrong-initial/wrong-surah paths; any future beam hint must first prove calibration against diagnostics.
