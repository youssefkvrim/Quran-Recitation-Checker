/**
 * The ONNX injection seam.
 *
 * `@tilawa/core` is runtime-agnostic: it never imports `onnxruntime-*`.
 * Instead the app developer wires in their runtime of choice (onnxruntime-web,
 * onnxruntime-node, onnxruntime-react-native, ...) behind this interface.
 *
 * The contract mirrors the model graph exactly: feed mono 16kHz float32 PCM
 * as `audio_signal` `[1, N]` plus its `length` `[1]`, receive `[1, T, vocab]`
 * log-probabilities flattened row-major into `logprobs` (length `T * vocab`).
 * Preprocessing (mel, normalization) is baked into the graph.
 *
 * Reference implementations for each runtime live in the README. The web demo's
 * adapter is `web/frontend/src/worker/session.ts`.
